# H2H Sorter
A new type of sorter that presents the user with head-to-heads over and over again until there is a final sorted list of all options.

## Introduction

With the advent of tier list makers as an internet fad, I've had my own try at making a few of them. However,
after a few attempts, I often found myself being frustrated because the final tier list... never looked right. I
was always wondering about two or three placements that seemed "off," and the end user experience was that
I often left more annoyed than anything else.

After some analysis of the situation, I identified the source of much of my frustrations: it's hard to rank everything
all at once with no starting point at all. For example, you'll think that bananas are A tier and put them there, but then
are they really A tier when there's apples who also seem A tier? Wait I just put watermelons in B tier and there's no way
bananas are higher-- and so on and so forth.

While brainstorming new ways to rank things, I remembered a character sorter I had used a few years ago. This sorter
forced the user to analyze head-to-heads over and over again until, using the magic of logic and math, there was one
"complete" ranking. This seemed far more easy to me. It's far more daunting to ask someone to rank 10 things than to ask
them to choose between two multiple times. Less options means an easier time.

So, I quickly compiled this website that lets you sort anything you want using head-to-heads. Hopefully this will be of
some use to some of you!

## Note

I don't think method is 100% superior to tier lists or other forms of personal rankings. But, it's always good to have more
options and to put this out there. To be clear, this isn't meant to replace anything, just to provide another
way to rank lists.
